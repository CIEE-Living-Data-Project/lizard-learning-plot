	abstract = {Evidence of social learning, whereby the actions of an animal facilitate the acquisition of new information by another, is taxonomically biased towards mammals, especially primates, and birds. However, social learning need not be limited to group-living animals because species with less interaction can still benefit from learning about potential predators, food sources, rivals and mates. We trained male skinks (Eulamprus quoyii), a mostly solitary lizard from eastern Australia, in a two-step foraging task. Lizards belonging to ‘young’ and ‘old’ age classes were presented with a novel instrumental task (displacing a lid) and an association task (reward under blue lid). We did not find evidence for age-dependent learning of the instrumental task; however, young males in the presence of a demonstrator learnt the association task faster than young males without a demonstrator, whereas old males in both treatments had similar success rates. We present the first evidence of age-dependent social learning in a lizard and suggest that the use of social information for learning may be more widespread than previously believed.},

	abstract = {Many animals, including humans, acquire valuable skills and knowledge by copying others. Scientists refer to this as social learning. It is one of the most exciting and rapidly developing areas of behavioral research and sits at the interface of many academic disciplines, including biology, experimental psychology, economics, and cognitive neuroscience. Social Learning provides a comprehensive, practical guide to the research methods of this important emerging field. William Hoppitt and Kevin Laland define the mechanisms thought to underlie social learning and demonstrate how to distinguish them experimentally in the laboratory. They present techniques for detecting and quantifying social learning in nature, including statistical modeling of the spatial distribution of behavior traits. They also describe the latest theory and empirical findings on social learning strategies, and introduce readers to mathematical methods and models used in the study of cultural evolution. This book is an indispensable tool for researchers and an essential primer for students. Provides a comprehensive, practical guide to social learning research Combines theoretical and empirical approaches Describes techniques for the laboratory and the field Covers social learning mechanisms and strategies, statistical modeling techniques for field data, mathematical modeling of cultural evolution, and more},

	abstract = {Based on its mandibular gland secretion, the earless monitor lizard, Lanthanotus borneensis, has been considered a venomous animal like other members of the Toxicofera group, including Heloderma. In the present study, the gland structure and teeth of L. borneensis were examined by micro-tomography (μCT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively, and proteomic analysis of the gland extract was performed. The mandibular gland consists of six compartments with separate ducts. The pleurodont teeth of the lower and upper jaw are not grooved but possess a sharp ridge on the anterior surface. Proteomic analysis of the gland extract confirmed previous studies that kallikrein enzymes are the major biologically active components. In view of the lizard's biology, its mandibular gland secretion is obviously not needed for prey capture or defence. It seems not justified the labelling of L. borneensis as a venomous animal. However, definitively answering this question requires toxinological studies on natural prey.},
