	abstract = {Many animals, including humans, acquire valuable skills and knowledge by copying others. Scientists refer to this as social learning. It is one of the most exciting and rapidly developing areas of behavioral research and sits at the interface of many academic disciplines, including biology, experimental psychology, economics, and cognitive neuroscience. Social Learning provides a comprehensive, practical guide to the research methods of this important emerging field. William Hoppitt and Kevin Laland define the mechanisms thought to underlie social learning and demonstrate how to distinguish them experimentally in the laboratory. They present techniques for detecting and quantifying social learning in nature, including statistical modeling of the spatial distribution of behavior traits. They also describe the latest theory and empirical findings on social learning strategies, and introduce readers to mathematical methods and models used in the study of cultural evolution. This book is an indispensable tool for researchers and an essential primer for students. Provides a comprehensive, practical guide to social learning research Combines theoretical and empirical approaches Describes techniques for the laboratory and the field Covers social learning mechanisms and strategies, statistical modeling techniques for field data, mathematical modeling of cultural evolution, and more},

	abstract = {Assisted reproductive technologies for population and genetic management for threatened herpetofauna have grown substantially in the past decade. Here we describe experiments to optimise sperm cryopreservation in a model squamate, the eastern water skink Eulamprus quoyii. Small, concentrated volumes of highly motile spermatozoa were reliably collected from adult male E. quoyii by non-lethal ventral massage. Samples were used to: (1) test whether protein-rich diluents, namely Beltsville poultry semen extender (BPSE) and TES and Tris (TEST) yolk buffer (TYB), improve post-thaw quality metrics compared with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS); and (2) compare the efficacy of these diluents in combination with either 1.35 M glycerol or 1.35 M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at two freezing rates, fast (approximately –20°C min−1) versus slow (–6°C min−1). Glycerol and DMSO performed equally well in preserving spermatozoa under slow freezing rates. Under these conditions, the use of the complex diluents BPSE and TYB significantly improved post-thaw total motility compared with DPBS. Complex interactions occurred between cryodiluent type, cryoprotectant and freezing rate when testing fast versus slow freezing rates among treatment groups. Under slow freezing rates, DMSO was better at preserving membrane integrity and motility, regardless of diluent type, but successful fast freezing required complex diluents to support motility and membrane integrity, which has implications for implementation in a field setting.},

	abstract = {Frequent evolutionary changes in reproductive mode have produced a wide range of placental structures in viviparous squamate reptiles. Closely related species with different placental structures and resolved phylogenetic relationships are particularly useful for reconstructing how placentae might have transformed during the evolutionary process. We used light microscopy to study placental morphology in mid- to late stage embryos of four closely related species of Eulamprus, a genus of viviparous scincid lizards that we had reason to suspect may display significant interspecific variation in placental morphology. Embryos from all four species possess a chorioallantoic placenta, an omphaloplacenta and an interomphalopleuric membrane, characteristics present in other viviparous skinks. However, unlike other viviparous skinks but characteristic of oviparous skinks, the allantois expands to surround the yolk sac in each species, supplanting the omphalopleure with a larger area of chorioallantois until a chorioallantoic placenta surrounds the entire egg in one specimen that is only a few days from birth. All four Eulamprus species share the same extraembryonic membrane morphology, but the cellular morphology of the uterine epithelium in the chorioallantoic placenta and omphaloplacenta varies between species. We determined that the interomphalopleuric membrane is a shared derived character of the Eulamprus quoyii species group. New phylogenetic information indicates that variation in the chorioallantoic placenta is a result of two independent transitions, but that variation in the omphaloplacenta can be explained using a single change within the species studied. Our results indicate that E. quoyii group skinks are a valuable model for investigating the evolution of viviparity, as extraembryonic membrane development in these species shows features characteristic of both oviparous and viviparous skinks.},
